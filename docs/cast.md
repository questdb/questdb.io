Type conversion. Can be either

- [Explicit](#explicit-conversion) via `cast()`
- [Implicit](#implicit-conversion), in which case it will be automatically
  performed when required by the context.

## Explicit conversion

Types can be converted from one to another using the `cast()` function.

### Syntax

![cast sql syntax](/img/doc/diagrams/cast.svg)

where:

- `expression` can be a constant, a column, or an expression that evaluates to a
  value.
- `type` refers to the desired [data type](datatypes.md).

`cast` can be used a part of arithmetic expression as normal

### Examples

```questdb-sql title="Queries"
SELECT cast(3L + 2L as int), cast FROM long_sequence(1);
SELECT cast(1578506142000000 as timestamp) FROM long_sequence(1);
SELECT cast('10.2' as double) FROM long_sequence(1); --string to double
SELECT cast('è¡Œ' as int) FROM long_sequence(1);
```

```script title="Results"
| cast                        |
|-----------------------------|
| 5                           |
| 2020-01-08T17:55:42.000000Z |
| 10.2                        |
| 34892                       |
```

- Casting a decimal number type (`float` or `double`) to an integer number type
  (`long`, `int`, `short`) will result in decimals drop.
- If the integer part being cast is larger than the resulting data type, it will
  be resized by truncating bits.
- Conversions from `char` to a number type will return the corresponding
  `unicode` number and vice versa.

### Precision loss examples

```questdb-sql title="Queries"
SELECT cast(3.5 + 2 as int), cast FROM long_sequence(1);
SELECT cast(7234623 as short) FROM long_sequence(1);
SELECT cast(2334444.323 as short) FROM long_sequence(1);
```

```script title="Results"
| cast                        |
|-----------------------------|
| 5                           | -- Loss of the decimals
| 25663                       | -- Int truncated to Short*
| -24852                      | -- Loss of decimals and integer part bits are truncated resulting in another number
```

When casting numbers into a smaller data type, QuestDB will truncate the higher
bits of this number.

## Implicit conversion

Type casting may be necessary in certain context such as

- Operations involving various different types
- Inserting values where the originating type is different from the destination
  column type.

QuestDB will attempt to convert to the data type required by the context. This
is called `implicit cast` and does not require using the `cast()` function.

:::note
QuestDB will only perform implicit cast when they would not result in
data being truncated or precision being lost.

The below chart illustrates the explicit and implicit cast available in QuestDB.

:::note
Implicit casting prevents data loss. When an operation involves multiple
types, the resulting type will be the smallest possible type so that no data is
lost.

```questdb-sql title="Queries"
SELECT 1234L + 567 FROM long_sequence(1);
SELECT 1234L + 0.567 FROM long_sequence(1);
SELECT to_timestamp('2019-10-17T00:00:00', 'yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss') + 323 FROM long_sequence(1);
SELECT to_timestamp('2019-10-17T00:00:00', 'yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss') + 0.323 FROM long_sequence(1);
```

```script title="Results"
| 1801                           | -- Returns a long.
| 1234.567                       | -- Implicit cast to double.
| 2019-10-17T00:00:00.000323Z    | -- Returns a timestamp with an extra 323 microseconds.
| 1571270400000000               | -- Implicit cast to double as timestamp are long integers.
```

> When inserting into a table, QuestDB will cast data implicitly to match the
> type of the destination column.

```questdb-sql title="Example"
-- We create a table with one column of type long
CREATE TABLE my_table(my_number long);

-- We then insert a value into this table. Note that the value is of timestamp type
-- but that we are trying to insert into a long type column:
INSERT INTO my_table values((to_timestamp('2019-10-17T00:00:00', 'yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss'));

-- As timestamp can be converted to long without loss, QuestDB performs an implicit
-- cast on the value before inserting it. Therefore the value is now stored as a long:
SELECT * FROM my_table;
```

```script title="Result"
| 1571270400000000   | -- Returns a long.
```

The above insert would have been equivalent to running with explicit cast, but
QuestDB took care of this step automatically.

```questdb-sql title="Example"
INSERT INTO my_table values
            (cast(
                to_timestamp('2019-10-17T00:00:00', 'yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss')
                as long
            ))
```

```script title="Result"
| 1571270400000000   |
```
