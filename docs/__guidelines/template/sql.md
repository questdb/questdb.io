`KEYWORD` does something interesting.

## Syntax

![meaningful alt text](/img/doc/diagrams/case-def.svg)

Some arguments may need explanations.

- `this` does that and is useful
- `this` does that and is also useful

## Examples

Examples can be introduced by some text. Ideally they are made clear enough so
that neither text nor output example is required. There should be many examples
describing various situations.

```questdb-sql title="This example does that"
SELECT a FROM b;
```

```questdb-sql title="Do something interesting"
SELECT a FROM b;
```

```questdb-sql title="Something else, equally interesting"
SELECT a FROM b;
```

```questdb-sql title="This is only interesting for certain users"
SELECT a FROM b;
```

```questdb-sql title="Some may not find this interesting at all"
SELECT a FROM b;
```

```questdb-sql title="That's starting to be a lot of examples"
SELECT a FROM b;
```

```questdb-sql title="The more, the merrier they say"
SELECT a FROM b;
```
