When looking at multiple solutions for storing and analyzing large amounts of
time series data, it's common to see many open source systems claim that they
are the easiest to maintain or are the fastest and most efficient at storing and
writing data. Reliable comparisons are one of the best ways for users to make
the decision which system fits their needs in terms of resource usage, speed,
ease of use and other requirements.

We decided to make it more transparent for developers to choose the right time
series database by providing support for testing and measuring database
performance that anyone can replicate.

<h2>How is database performance measured?</h2>

While there are many ways to measure database performance, we saw the
[Time Series Benchmark Suite](https://github.com/timescale/tsbs) (TSBS)
regularly coming up in discussions about time series databases and decided we
should provide the ability to benchmark QuestDB along with other systems.

The TSBS is a collection of Go programs to generate datasets and then benchmark
read and write performance. It was initially released by InfluxDB engineers and
continuously improved by the TimescaleDB team. The suite is extensible so that
different types of data and query types can be included and compared across
systems.

<h3>The data format used for testing ingestion</h3>

Data for the QuestDB ingestion benchmark is generated in
[InfluxDB line protocol](/docs/guides/influxdb-line-protocol/) format where each
reading is composed of the table name, several comma-separated tags, several
comma-separated fields, and a timestamp for the record. An example reading looks
like the following:

```text
diagnostics,name=truck_3985,fleet=West,driver=Seth,model=H-2,device_version=v1.5 load_capacity=1500,fuel_capacity=150,nominal_fuel_consumption=12,fuel_state=0.8,current_load=482,status=4i 1451609990000000000
```

The data generation tool is configurable so that the number of simulated devices
can be increased using `scale`, and the overall timespan that devices are
generating test data can be specified by a start and end timestamp:

```bash
tsbs_generate_data \
--use-case="cpu-only" --seed=123 --scale=4000 \
--timestamp-start="2016-01-01T00:00:00Z" --timestamp-end="2016-01-02T00:00:00Z" \
--log-interval="10s" --format="influx" > /tmp/data
```

This will create a data set with:

- 24 hours worth of data
- 4000 simulated host machines
- each simulated host reports system metrics every 10 seconds
- records are in InfluxDB line protocol format with 10 tags and 10 fields per
  row

The total size of the data set generated from this command is approximately
12GB.

<h3>Performance-testing time series data ingestion</h3>

The Time Series Benchmark Suite provides a separate tool for loading the
generated data set into different databases. Users can test ingestion
performance using the `tsbs_load` and specify the system to send the test data
to:

```bash
tsbs_load_questdb --file /tmp/data --workers 4
```

This creates a table with 34.5 million rows:

<h2>Time Series Benchmark Suite results</h2>

Here are our results of the benchmark with the `cpu-only` use case using up to
fourteen workers on an AWS EC2 `m5.8xlarge` instance with sixteen cores.

/>

We reach maximum ingestion performance using four threads, whereas the other
systems require more CPU resources to hit maximum throughput. QuestDB achieves
959k rows/sec with 4 threads. We find that InfluxDB needs 14 threads to reach
its max ingestion rate (334k rows/sec), while TimescaleDB reaches 145k rows/sec
with 4 threads. ClickHouse hits 914k rows/sec with twice as many threads as
QuestDB.

When running on 4 threads, QuestDB is 1.7x faster than ClickHouse, 6.4x faster
than InfluxDB and 6.5x faster than TimescaleDB.

Because our ingestion format (ILP) repeats tag values per row, ClickHouse and
TimescaleDB parse around two-thirds of the total volume of data as QuestDB does
in the same benchmark run. We chose to stick with ILP because of its widespread
use in time series, but we may use a more efficient format to improve ingestion
performance in the future.

Degraded performance beyond 4 workers can be explained by the increased
contention beyond what the system is capable of. We think that one limiting
factor may be that we are IO bound as we scale up to 30% better on faster
AMD-based systems.

When we run the suite again using an AMD Ryzen5 processor, we found that we were
able to hit maximum throughput of 1.43 million rows per second using 5 threads.
This is compared to the
[Intel Xeon Platinum](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) that's in use
by our reference benchmark `m5.8xlarge` instance on AWS.

<h2>Contributing to the Time Series Benchmark Suite</h2>

We have opened a pull request
([#157 - Questdb benchmark support](https://github.com/timescale/tsbs/issues/157)) in
TimescaleDB's TSBS GitHub repository which adds the ability to run the benchmark
against QuestDB. In the meantime, readers may clone
[our fork of the benchmark suite](https://github.com/questdb/tsbs) and run the
tests to see the results for themselves.

<h2>Get in touch</h2>

Version 6.0 of QuestDB ships with a new ingestion framework which is a new way
to sort incoming data without the performance cost that standard methods
experience during query operations and has no bottlenecks on ingestion.

With the addition of this feature, we're happy to provide compatibility with the
Time Series Benchmark Suite, which is a reproducible way to compare query and
ingestion performance across multiple systems. With this compatibility, we hope
to make it easier to assess which time series database is the proper tool for a
particular use case.

arise when dealing with large amounts of time series data, feel free to
