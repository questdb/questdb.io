          <h3>Why Innova migrated to QuestDB</h3>
          <p className="font-size--large">
            Innova found QuestDB because of its requirements to store and
            analyze massive amounts of data that needs to be served to their
            customers quickly. The data Innova collects makes sense when
            customers can instantly understand how it changes over time. The
            search for a database that can display this kind of information in a
            timeline as fast as possible led to QuestDB.
          </p>
          <p className="font-size--large">
            Innova’s client is one of the largest telecommunications providers
            in Turkey, serving internet connections to over 5 million customers.
            Infrastructure at this scale uses massive amounts of resources and
            generates a tremendous volume of data. Innova uses operational data
            from this provider to show their customers information about their
            own internet connections, such as the quality of service, download
            speed, upload speed, bandwidth, and more.
          </p>

          <h3>How Innova collect and analyze big data with QuestDB</h3>
          <p className="font-size--large">
            Innova store the bandwidth data of devices in Fiber To The Home
            (FTTH) topology from collectors, which run on hourly intervals.
            These collector jobs contain time series for each device in JSON
            format and based on this metadata, Innova produce visualizations for
            their customers to have insights into their network quality. For a
            customer, this means that they have access to charts, tables, and
            line graphs so they can see the state of their connectivity for the
            last 30 days.
          </p>
          <img
            alt="Chart showing the average transaction duration for QuestDB on a given day"
            className={chCss.chart}
            height={519}
            src="/img/pages/case-study/innova/chart.png"
            width={842}
          />
          <h3>Why Innova use a time series database for big data</h3>
          <p className="font-size--large">
            The original stack built by Innova relied on MongoDB to store
            connectivity information, which was convenient at first. However, it
            soon became apparent that MongoDB was tightly dependent on physical
            resources and required more powerful hardware that they were happy
            with allocating. Moreover, as data sets grew in MongoDB, query
            speeds degraded below what was acceptable for their customers.
          </p>
          <p className="font-size--large">
            For communicating with QuestDB, Innova uses the Docker deploy for
            running production instances and query data via REST API to generate
            charts and insights. On average, Innova is writing hundreds of
            millions of records per day while performing calculations on an
            ever-changing data set. Usually, Innova will keep 30 days of data in
            QuestDB and delete older partitions when they become less useful for
            actionable insights.
